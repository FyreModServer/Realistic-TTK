# Realistic-TTK
Sick of having to mag-dump or land 3+ hits on centre mass before they're *close* to death? Well this game makes the TTK more like Hell Let Loose where a single rifle round to the torso is typically fatal; this mod aims to recreate that level of realism. They could be far away and all you have is an innaccurate gun. Well if one of those bullets lands anywhere that armour wasn't able to stop then they'll be mortally wounded and require bandages, painkillers etc. HP and other flesh-damage ammo now causes light bleeds no matter what but usually it will be a heavy bleed..Also typically one round to any limb will cripple it. Armour is incredibly hard to acquire and instead of level 6 the highest is now Level 4. All with reduced overall durability.
